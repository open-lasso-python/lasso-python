      # E501:
      #   We disable too long lines in ArrayType since the docstrings for arrays
      #   must be behind the arrays for sphinx, thus lines cannot be shortened.
      #   Anyhow if you find any way to change feel free to submit a PR.
      # E203:
      #   We ignore E203 since allowing whitespace around ':' makes slicing
      #   more understandable when doing complex slicing.
      # W503:
      #   Allowing operators such as '+' after a new line instead of putting it
      #   on the previous one, complex condition chains are more understandable.
